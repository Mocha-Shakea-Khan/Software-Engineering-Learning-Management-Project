I was considering adding an administrator entity, but I�m not sure how to implement one. If we find a way to implement an administrator, we can add the entity and use case for one, if not I�ll remove administrator from the document. I also don't know how we should implement grading. I know it shouln't be too complex, but i'd rather not go for the simpliest option unless there's no other choice. I'm thinking of a few methods, but i'm open to ideas so for now i'll keep the grading use case empty.
If there�s anything else you guys want to add, remove or edit please feel free to do it.
